Welcome to this beginner's guide on using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for data science. This guide will walk you through setting up VSCode, using Jupyter notebooks, and getting started with a data science project.

## Ways to Run Python Code

Before exploring Visual Studio Code, let's understand the different ways to execute Python code. Running Python can be achieved through several methods, each tailored to various needs and scenarios. Here are some of the most common approaches:

### 1. Python Interpreter (Command Line)
- **Interactive Shell:** Run `python` or `python3` in the command line.
- **Script Execution:** Run scripts using `python filename.py`.

### 2. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
- **Examples:** PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, Eclipse with PyDev.
- **Features:** Code completion, debugging, project management.

### 3. Text Editors with Python Support
- **Examples:** Sublime Text, Atom, Notepad++.
- **Features:** Syntax highlighting, script execution.

### 4. Jupyter Notebooks
- **Usage:** Interactive documents with live code, visualizations.
- **Execution:** Run code cells independently.

### 5. Online Python Interpreters and IDEs
- **Examples:** Repl.it, Google Colab, PythonAnywhere.
- **Convenience:** Write and execute code in a web browser.


## VSCode

- VSCode (Visual Studio Code) is a lightweight but powerful source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.
- VSCode is a free and very popular code editor among developers. It is a very powerful tool for writing code in various programming languages.

## What is Jupyter Notebook ?

Jupyter (formerly [IPython Notebook](https://ipython.org/notebook.html)) is an [open-source project](https://jupyter.org) that combines Markdown text and executable Python source code on a canvas called a notebook, widely used in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning. 

### Key Points:

- **Open-Source Project**: Combines Markdown and Python code in one notebook.
- **Wide Usage**: Ideal for data science, scientific computing, and machine learning.
- **Interactive Computing**: Execute code in segments with immediate output visualization.
- **Language Support**: Compatible with over 40 languages, including Python and R.
- **Data Visualization Integration**: Works seamlessly with various graphing libraries.
- **Educational Tool**: Facilitates interactive learning in coding and data science.
- **Research and Professional Use**: Aids in reproducible research with rich text support.
- **Visual Studio Code Integration**: Supports Jupyter Notebooks natively.



You can do all of your data science work within VS Code using Jupyter Notebook.

## Working with Jupyter Notebooks in VSCode

To work with Python in Jupyter Notebooks, you must activate a conda environment in VS Code, or another Python environment in which you've installed the Jupyter package. To select an environment, use the `Python: Select Interpreter` command from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P). Once the appropriate environment is activated, you can create and open a Jupyter Notebook, and export a Jupyter Notebook as a Python file.


### Step 3: Open or Create a Jupyter Notebook

- Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type `Jupyter: Create New Blank Jupyter Notebook`.
- Alternatively, you can open an existing `.ipynb` file by right-clicking on the file and opening with VS Code, or through the VS Code File Explorer.
- If you don't have Jupyter installed, you will be prompted to install it. Follow the instructions provided.

        </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Next, select a kernel using the kernel picker in the top right.


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
        <a href="vscode.md">
            <img src="media/jupyter2.png" alt="VSCode setup" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
        </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

After selecting a kernel, the language picker located in the bottom right of each code cell will automatically update to the language supported by the kernel.

        </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

> If you have an existing Jupyter Notebook, you can open it by right-clicking on the file and opening with VS Code, or through the VS Code File Explorer.


After setting up Visual Studio Code for Jupyter Notebooks, the next step is to understand how to work effectively with code cells in the Notebook Editor. The next section discuss the process of creating, running, and managing code cells in Jupyter Notebooks within VS Code.


### Step 5: Run Notebook Cells

- Once you have a notebook, you can write your Python code in a cell.
- Use `Shift+Enter` to run the cell and see the output below the cell 
- Alternatively, you can run a code cell using the Run icon to the left of the cell and the output will appear directly below the code cell.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
        <a href="vscode.md">
            <img src="media/runjupyter.png" alt="VSCode setup" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
        </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

You can run multiple cells by selecting Run All, Run All Above, or Run All Below.


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
        <a href="vscode.md">
            <img src="media/runjupyterall.png" alt="VSCode setup" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
        </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Save your Jupyter Notebook

You can save your Jupyter Notebook using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+S` or `File > Save`.

## Export your Jupyter Notebook

- You can export a Jupyter Notebook as a Python file (.py), a PDF, or an HTML file. To export, select the Export action on the main toolbar.
- You'll then be presented with a dropdown of file format options.



<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
        <a href="vscode.md">
            <img src="media/exportjupyter.png" alt="VSCode setup" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
        </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Starting a Data Science Project

### Step 1: Create a Project Folder

- Choose a location on your computer and create a new folder for your project.
- If you have an existing folder, move to step 2.

### Step 2: Open the Folder in VSCode

- In VSCode, go to `File > Open Folder` and select your project folder.

### Step 3: Explore Data

- Create a new Jupyter notebook following the steps above and start exploring your data.

### Step 4: Save and Share Your Notebook

- Save your work by clicking on the save icon or using Ctrl+S.
- You can share your .ipynb notebook file with others, or upload it to a repository on GitHub.
